# **Automation**

**[DRAFTED]** The **Automation** feature allows you to generate documents in a powerful way: **in batches, dynamically, and on a schedule**. This helps you create a large number of documents without any manual effort.

## **Automated Batch Export**

You can create documents for many users at once by simply **looping** through a **collection** or array of data.

```
...
```

All invoices are created **automatically** and can be exported to multiple formats.

## **Scheduled Automation (Task Scheduler)**

By integrating this package with the **Laravel Scheduler**, you can create documents on a **predetermined schedule**.

```
...
```

Documents are created **automatically every month** without any manual intervention.

## **Automation with Dynamic Templates**

Templates can be populated with **automatic variables** fetched directly from your database or an external API.

```
